A repository of any MATLAB programs made for "Engineering Computing with Applications (EGR111)" while at the University
of Portland. Any original code will be marked so- this repository is for my personal educational use only,
along with keeping an updated, version-controlled, cloud-based storage for all code written while at the University
of Portland.

This repository may also be used to show educational instructors or businesses my personal coding history.

Date: Spring, 2014
Location: University of Portland
Professor: Dr. Timothy A. Doughty
Language(s): MATLAB

Notes: Dr.Doughty is awesome, and managed to teach me a how to use a whole new language while I was still learning how to use Java- it's thanks to him that I've managed to pick up Python so quickly, due to my foundation in MATLAB.
