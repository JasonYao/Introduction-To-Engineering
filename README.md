# EGR 111: Introduction to Engineering Programming Assignments
By Jason Yao

## Description
A repository of any MATLAB programmes made for "Intro to Engineering (EGR 111)" 
while at the University of Portland.

Any code not my own is marked so, and their respective authors retain full rights. 

This repository's purpose is to showcase programming assignments completed for this course.

Date: Spring, 2014

Location: University of Portland

Professor: Dr. Timothy A. Doughty

Language(s): MATLAB

## Course outcomes
- Learned how to design, write, execute, and debug MATLAB computer programmes

- Learned foundational computer science information including:
	- Variable assignment
	- Indexing
	- Plotting
	- Importing and exporting data
	- Loops
	- Branching
	- Script files
	- User-defined functions

- Demonstrated skills in designing, implementing, documenting, testing, debugging, 
and analysing programmes in the context of engineering problems.

- Applied MATLAB to technical problems in multiple engineering disciplines with 
applications such as image and sound processing, heat transfer, and 
stress/strain analysis.

## Thanks
Dr.Doughty is an amazing instructor, and I've had the privilege to have him teach me 
how to use a whole new programming language while still learning how to use Java - 
it's thanks to him that I've managed to pick up general computational skills so quickly,
allowing me to branch out to other languages, frameworks, and mindsets, due to my
foundation in this course.
